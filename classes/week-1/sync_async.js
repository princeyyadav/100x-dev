// synchronous
/*
one after other, sequential, only one thing is happening at a time

Asynchronous
Happens in parts
Multiple things are context switching with others

Async fns vs async fns

Some intuition:
Human body is single threaded:
we can only do one task at a time
But we can context switch between tasks or we can delegate tasks to other people

Same thing is with JS
JS is single threaded

Make maggie:
Boil water
Cut maggie packet
Chop veggies
Buy catchup from market

Sequential way: one thing at a time (37m)

Async way: 12m
Boil water
Delegates buying ketchup
Cut maggie packet
Chops veggies
